# DECENTRALIZED CROWDFUNDING

The primary objective of this project is to establish a decentralized and transparent crowdfunding platform. Traditional crowdfunding applications suffer from issues related to centralization, such as the risk of a single point of failure and concerns regarding trust. To address these drawbacks, this project aims to leverage blockchain technology to decentralize the application and mitigate the associated challenges. By implementing a decentralized approach, we seek to enhance reliability, eliminate central points of failure, and foster trust within the crowdfunding ecosystem.
